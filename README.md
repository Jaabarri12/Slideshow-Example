4. 2+ geometric shapes (rendered in-engine)
5. 1+ big fancy text (composed out of engine)
6. 1+ multi-line text (rendered in-engine)
7. 1+ fading scene transition (e.g. fade to black)
8. 1+ object motion animation (e.g. sliding in from the side)

## How it is Incorporated

1. There are technically 4 scenes, first the scene to commence, the second is the studio, third is the 
   tid bit about the game, and the final is the "game scene"
2. There are a few audio sets, the studio sounc, mountains rising, and the game music
3. Everything is basically images the game screen, mountains, studio art
4. There are to rectangles that surround the text in the scenes
5. The game title is made outside the engine added in as a image
6. I saw no way to incorporate this so I just used regular text but it was only one line
7. All the scenes fade in and out of one another
8. All the objects the appear from off screen
